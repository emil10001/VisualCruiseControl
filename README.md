Requires SimpleLocations library.

This is a very simple visual cruise control app.
The idea is that you set your desired speed, and
the screen will change color depending on if you
are above or below the desired speed. You can
hit the 'Stop' button at stop signs and it will
stop recording gps data until you hit 'Start'.
